       which bears a forward-facing eye and a downward-facing mouth, which is 
       surrounded by extremely strong dangling tentacles.  Fish have 
       control over their buoyancy, like a submarine.  Fish eat sea
       plants, minerals, and small water animals.  They are representatives
       of the most primitive animals on the rikchik homeworld to be able to
