The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger,
 when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
 They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making
 the traveller take his cloak off should be considered
 stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as
 hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely
 did the traveller fold his cloak around him; and at last
 the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shone
 out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his
 cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess
 that the sun was the stronger of the two.

A wind from the north and a sun, both animate, were saying "this sun is the
strongest (literally, most watery) among us, or this wind is the strongest
among us."

Then, a movey human, hiding with a cloak, came to where the two were.

The wind blew most hard, and the quantity of that same hardness was 
the nearness that the human hid with that cloak, and the wind stopped.
