    <h1>Technical Notes</h1>
    <p>
    I use a bunch of behind-the-scenes technology to get Rikchik to look as 
    nice as it does, and to help keep track of it all.  This page describes
    my system, for the benefit of others wanting to do similar things and for
    the curious.
    </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    The data for the rikchik language is stored in an XML file.
    This XML file is parsed to create the dictionary pages, the postscript
    libraries and references, and the component images.  The component images
    are assembled into words and sentences by a CGI script, on the fly.
    </p>
    <h2>XML</h2>
    <p>
    The data for rikchik is stored in a single large XML file, though I have
    an "exploded" version scattered across ~300 directories to make it more
    tractable.  As of 5 Chaos 9, 14-Block 7, this XML file is 125K.  It's
    split up into the various components of Rikchik: 
    <a href="language/morpheme.html">morphemes</a>, 
    <a href="language/aspect.html">aspects</a>,
    <a href="language/relation.html">relations</a>, and 
    <a href="language/collector.html">collectors</a>.  (The symbols such as 
    <a href="http://suberic.net/~dmm/rikchik/math/numbers.html">the numerals</a> 
    are also stored here for convenience.)
    A lot of this data is definition information for
    use in 
    <a href="http://suberic.net/~dmm/rikchik/language/dictionary.html">the 
    dictionary pages</a>, including the various readings and roles
    for a morpheme, compound words, and occasionally etymologies.
    Naturally there's a lot more definition information in the morpheme 
    section.

&lt;/glyph&gt;
</pre>

	<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">The glyph definition for Want</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    Each individual component also includes a &lt;glyph&gt; section 
    which describes the appearance
    of that component.  Glyphs are made up of tentacles, of which there are 13
    types such as "circle", "squiggle", "wicket", and "halfhook".  Morphemes
    each include 4 tentacles, and other components just have 1.  Glyphs are
    laid out on a 100x100 grid, with each kind of component having a certain
    area available to it.  The order of the tentacles in a morpheme indicate 
    which tentacle a rikchik uses to sign each piece of the glyph - this data
    is used in the cursive libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
    When I create a new morpheme, I sketch it out on a whiteboard and then 
    start assigning tentacles to it.  It's pretty straightforward to type
    the XML in directly.  Then I fill in some of the definition fields, 
    re-compress the XML file from the exploded version, and run the rest of
    the process to update the various pieces of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
    The XML master file is kept in "rikchik" order, to allow the dictionary
    to use 
    <a href="http://suberic.net/~dmm/rikchik/language/quicklist.html">that 
    sorting</a> in addition to alphabetical.
    </p>
    <h2>XSL</h2>
    <p>
    The dictionary is maintained using a number of XSL scripts.  These create
    the main dictionary indexes, the sub-pages, etc.  They were mostly written
    by my brother so I don't have much to say about them - they work, and
    that's good.  All the rikchik images that appear in the dictionary use
    the component images or the word assembly cgi script, described below.
    </p>
    <h2>PostScript</h2>
    <p>
    A perl script reads in the xml file and creates a postscript file, 
    <a href="ps/ps.html">rikchik.ps</a>, containing all the components 
    of the language.  This file
    is effectively a rikchik library for the postscript programming language -
    it doesn't actually draw anything.  This file pulls in a library I wrote
    which knows how to draw each type of tentacle, as well as how to draw the
    various type styles.  I used to maintain this file separately by hand - 
    this way is definitely better.
    </p>
    <p>
    Another perl script reads the .ps file and creates 
    <a href="ps/reference.ps">reference.ps</a>, a document showing each 
    component and its name.  It then uses ghostscript
    to make <a href="ps/reference.pdf">a pdf version</a>.  This file uses 
    the "classic" type style.
    </p>

    </table>
    <h2>Component images</h2>
    <p>
    Yet another perl script reads in rikchik.ps and draws the component 
    images.  Each component in rikchik is rendered into a png file, once for 
    each type style (classic, blunt, and pointy) and each size (1, 2, 3, and 
    5).  The non-morpheme components are also rendered both in black and in 
    their appropriate color for the "learning" mode.  The script does this 
    by creating small postscript files that draw the component in the 
    required size, style, and color, and calling ghostscript to render them 
    as images.  These component images are put into an organized directory 
    structure.  This script takes a while to draw everything, so it's written
    to allow me to just redraw certain components as needed.  
    </p>
    <h2>Word assembly</h2>
    <table align="right" style="border:2px solid black">
    <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="http://suberic.net/~dmm/cgi-bin/rikchik.cgi?size=5&style=blunt&Want-V-End-0"/></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>http://suberic.net/~dmm/cgi-bin/rikchik.cgi?size=5&style=blunt&Want-V-End-0</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    The actual word and sentence images that I use are created on-demand by
    a perl CGI script using the GD library to combine the component images
    into full rikchik words.  It supports the various sizes and styles, as
    well as wrapping lines vertically.
    </p>
    <p>
    A similar script takes the same input and diagrams the sentence or 
    sentences, including dealing with pronomials.
