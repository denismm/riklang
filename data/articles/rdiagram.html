<h1>The Rikchik Relations Diagram</h1>
<img src="images/RDiagram.png" alt="Diagram">
<p>
This diagram shows the parts of an action, and serves as a mnemonic
for the rikchik relation symbols.  In left-to-right order, they are:

<ul>
  <li><img src="images/5/rAgent.png" alt="(relation)">Someone does something (Agent)...
  <li><img src="images/5/rSource.png" alt="(relation)">...from somewhere (Source / Cause)...
  <li><img src="images/5/rInstrument.png" alt="(relation)">...using something (Instrument)...
  <li><img src="images/5/rQuality.png" alt="(relation)">...in a certain way (Quality)...
  <li><img src="images/5/rDestination.png" alt="(relation)">...toward somewhere (Destination)...
  <li><img src="images/5/rPatient.png" alt="(relation)">...to something (Patient).
</ul>
For the basic noun-to-verb relation, these would tag the nouns and the
verb would collect them.
<p>
As an example, the sentence on the right side of this page uses all of these
to say,
&quot;A rikchik happily moves a human from a home to a tree using water&quot;
or, more literally, 
&quot;Rikchik, from home, using water, in happy way,
toward tree, human, moves.&quot;
<p>
Not every relation is meaningful to every action, and these are used in
connections that are not noun-to-verb, but this is the basic meaning of
each.<p>
This covers all the primary relations but two: these are:
<ul>
  <li><img src="images/5/rIncludes.png" alt="(relation)">Includes: The first word includes or
    contains the collecting word
  <li><img src="images/5/rEnd.png" alt="(relation)">End: The word is considered resolved.
</ul>

The reciprocal relations are not used as often: their meaning is that of 
the main diagram relations (except Instrument, which has no reciprocal)
but with the roles of the collected and collecting word reversed.  They
are written as a horizontal flip of their originals.
<ul>
  <li><img src="images/5/rTask.png" alt="Task"> (Task) is the reciprocal of 
    <img src="images/5/rAgent.png" alt="Agent"> (Agent).
  <li><img src="images/5/rResult.png" alt="Result"> (Result) is the reciprocal of 
    <img src="images/5/rSource.png" alt="Source"> (Source).
  <li><img src="images/5/rExample.png" alt="Example"> (Example) is the reciprocal of 
    <img src="images/5/rQuality.png" alt="Quality"> (Quality).
  <li><img src="images/5/rMeans.png" alt="Means"> (Means) is the reciprocal of 
    <img src="images/5/rDestination.png" alt="Destination"> (Destination).
  <li><img src="images/5/rActor.png" alt="Actor"> (Actor) is the reciprocal of 
    <img src="images/5/rPatient.png" alt="Patient"> (Patient).
</ul>
In addition, Includes has a reciprocal that is written as a vertical flip.
<ul>
  <li><img src="images/5/rElement.png" alt="Element"> (Element) is the reciprocal of 
    <img src="images/5/rIncludes.png" alt="Includes"> (Includes).
</ul>
