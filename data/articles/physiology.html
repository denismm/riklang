<p>
Rikchiks (<i>ilpes sapiens</i>) are intelligent creatures native to the jungles
of the second planet of Alpha Centauri A.  Their culture and language is
described on the rest of this site.  This page describes their physiology.
</p>
<h2>Body Layout</h2>
<p>
An adult rikchik generally stands about 7 feet high, though it can crouch
down significantly or raise itself slightly.  Its body consists of a spherical
main section and 49 tentacles.  Rikchik skin is a medium green color.
</p>
<h3>Globe</h3>
<p>
The main body, or "globe", is about 2 feet in diameter and contains 
most of a rikchik's organs including its large single eye.  It has a hard 
surface - bonelike plates under the skin surface keep the body spherical.
The only apertures are the mouth (used for eating, breathing, and 
elimination), which is surrounded by the tentacles at the bottom of the globe,
and the eye, which is 90 degrees away on the front of the globe.  
</p>
<p>
The above-mentioned bonelike plates are connected to a very simple skeleton,
which mostly holds the plates in position.  Other organs are packed into
the globe - the heart centrally, the digestive system mostly surrounding 
the mouth, internal reproductive organs in front of the mouth, respiratory
system in the upper back area, and the brain in the upper front and
partially surrounding the eye.
</p>
<p>
The most notable difference in internal organs between humans and rikchiks
is that many human organs that are split into two parts are unitary in
rikchiks.  Rikchiks have a single eye, a single lung, 
a single set of chambers in the heart, 
a brain that is not split into two hemispheres, 
and a single organ for generating reproductive material.
</p>
<p>
The rikchik eyeball is almost a foot in diameter, and takes up a little less 
than an eighth of the globe.  The eye aperture is a constricting circle -
a closed rikchik eye looks like a small point.  Rikchiks have green irises.  
</p>
<h3>Tentacles</h3>
<p>
The 49 tentacles include 42 "standing" tentacles and 7 "talking" tentacles directly below the eye.
</p><p>
Standing tentacles are of a uniform color and are about 
1.5 inches thick and 5.5 feet long.  
They have a strong flexible center core of cartilage-like material, which
is surrounded by muscle.  The tentacle cores are connected to the 
lower globe plates, and can be chemically stiffened at will - rikchiks use
this ability to sleep standing up without exertion, and constantly adjust
the stiffness of their tentacles as they walk.
These tentacles are strong enough to lift burdens or
support the rikchik - generally about 15-20 tentacles are enough to support
a rikchik's weight.
</p>
<p>
Talking tentacles are about half as long and start the same thickness but taper to half that as they shade to white at the tips.  
They're not 
as strong but are much more dextrous and are used both for fine manipulation
and for the rikchik sign-language.  (This means that they can't talk while
doing fine manipulation, or at least will be less understandable, but have no
difficulty talking and eating simultaneously.)
</p>
<p>
Rikchiks generally stand with their tentacles slightly curved.  When awake, 
they bob up and down slightly - this helps with both respiration and depth 
perception.
</p>
<p>
If a rikchik loses a tentacle, it will regrow, slowly - up to a year 
to fully regenerate a standing tentacle, or two years for a (more complicated) 
talking tentacle.
</p>
<h2>Senses</h2>
<p>
Rikchiks consider themselves to have seven senses: sight, taste, 
globe-touch, tentacle-touch, pain, emotion, and environment.  Notably missing
is hearing - rikchiks are entirely deaf.
</p>
<p>
Sight: rikchik vision is similar to human vision in many ways.    Their
primary colors are close to ours.  The average rikchik is slightly 
farsighted compared to the average human, probably due to the larger size of
the rikchik eyeball.
</p>
<p>
Taste: this includes smell, as rikchiks can only smell through their mouths.
</p>
<p>
Globe-touch: touches to the rikchik's globe.  Globe skin is not as sensitive
as tentacle skin.
</p>
<p>
Tentacle-touch: sensitivity of tentacles is greater toward the tips, and
talking tentacles generally have more sensitivity than standing tentacles.
</p>
<p>
Emotion: rikchiks have an ability to perceive emotions directly (humans
would consider this a psychic ability).  This sense is somewhat directional
but does not have a high resolution.
</p>
<p>
Pain, Environment: rikchiks consider pain to be a separate sense, as well as
perception of environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity.
</p>
<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>
Rikchiks generally eat standing up, placing food into their mouths with their
tentacles.
</p>
<p>
Rikchiks have an ability (and in fact a need) to digest certain minerals
directly, by eating small rocks or other non-organic materials.  This
ability is widespread but not universal among the animals of their 
native planet.  However, this special digestive system is unable to process
meat with the same biology, making rikchiks biologically vegetarian.  The
rikchik diet consists mostly of fruit and nuts, giving them more energy than
most Earth herbivores.
</p>
<h2>Reproduction and Growth</h2>
<p>
Rikchiks are a single-gendered species.  Any rikchik can become pregnant
and from one to six other rikchiks can contribute genetic material to the
child.  Genetic material is transfered from globe-skin to globe-skin 
during the equivalent of intercourse.  A child gets half of its genes from 
its "parent" and the other half is a combination of genes from its 
"contributors".  The rikchik egg effectively has multiple seed receptors,
and begins to repel similar seed when each receptor has fertilized, so it
is easier for a rikchik to get pregnant with more contributors.  The child is
carried near the mouth, the parent's globe deforming to accomodate it.
</p>
<p>
Rikchiks are born with a slightly smaller globe and barely visible tentacles,
but the tentacles grow to about half adult length within a few years.  They
grow gradually after that, until their growth slows to almost zero at 
adulthood.  Tentacle growth never completely stops, and very old rikchiks have
noticeably longer tentacles.
</p>
<h2>Health and Environment</h2>
<p>
Rikchiks are most comfortable in their native jungles, but they have spread
across their planet.  They prefer warm temperatures - most rikchiks never
touch snow, and generally wear thick cloaks at temperatures below 60&deg; F /
15&deg; C.  They also prefer high humidity and must keep their skin
wet in dry environments.
</p>
<h2>Related organisms</h2>
<p>
Though 7-legged and 0-legged creatures are the norm in the rikchik biosphere,
rikchiks belong to a branch of primarily forest-dwelling animals that have
49 tentacles.  The "chimp" (<i>ilpes arborealis</i>) most closely resembles
a rikchik, but has a non-spherical globe and does not have lighter-colored
fine-manipulation tentacles.  More distantly related are the "lumpy-beast"
(<i>glaebifer vastitaticolus</i>) and the "roller" (<i>sphaera sphaera</i> et al.) which have 98 tentacles spread across their bodies.
