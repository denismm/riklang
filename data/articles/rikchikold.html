  The <a href="intro.html">rikchiks</a> speak in what would be called
  sign language by humans.  The rikchiks use 7 of their tentacles
  to speak with, putting each tentacle into a given shape and position to
  form a word.  A sequence of words is assembled 
  within the rikchik mind into a tree-like sentence structure.
  <p>
  There is now an incomplete but hopefully much clearer
  <a href="language/language.html">language reference</a> available.

  <h2><a name="words">Words</a></h2>
    Each word consists of 4 parts:
    <ul>
      <li>Glyph: basic concept (4 tentacles)
      <li>Relation: relationship to collecting word (1 tentacle)
      <li>Form: &quot;part of speech&quot; (1 tentacle)
      <li>Collector: number of previously uncollected words collected (1 
	tentacle)
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="glyph">Glyph</a></h3>
      A central, 4-tentacle symbol representing the basic concept of the word.
      See <a href="glyphdict.html">the glyph catalog</a> or 
      <a href="glyphlist.html">the glyph quick-reference</a>.
    <h3><a name="relation">Relation</a></h3>
      A 1-tentacle symbol on the top representing the connection this word has
      to the word that will collect it.  Rikchiks learn these using a diagram,
      shown below, about which <a href="rdiagram.html">more
      information is available.<br>
      <img src="images/RDiagram.png" alt="(Diagram)"></a>
      <br>
      Below is a list of relations.  In parentheses, the connection is
      explained using <em>T</em> to refer to the word tagged with
      this relation and using <em>C</em> to refer to the word collecting it.
      <dl>
	<dt><strong>Primary relations</strong>

      See <a href="rdiagram.html">the relation diagram</a> for more relation 
      explanation.
    <h3><a name="form">Form</a></h3>
      A 1-tentacle symbol on the lower left representing the &quot;part 
      of speech&quot; of the word.
      <ul>
	<li><img src="images/5/fR.png" alt="(form)"> Animate Noun:
	  used for living things and self-propelled machinery.
	<li><img src="images/5/fT.png" alt="(form)"> Inanimate Noun:
	  used for non-living things, including dead things.
	<li><img src="images/5/fV.png" alt="(form)"> Verb
	<li><img src="images/5/fM.png" alt="(form)"> Modifier (adjective/adverb)
	<li><img src="images/5/fN.png" alt="(form)"> Name:
	  replaces the form in a descriptive name to mark it as a name.
	<li><img src="images/5/fP.png" alt="(form)"> Place: may include time?
	<li><img src="images/5/fI.png" alt="(form)"> Idea:
	  any non-tangible noun that is not a place.
      </ul>
    <h3><a name="collector">Collector</a></h3>
      A 1-tentacle symbol on the lower left representing how many unresolved 
      words this word will collect.
      <ul>
	<li><img src="images/5/n0.png" alt="(collector)"> 0 (this word stands alone)
	<li><img src="images/5/n1.png" alt="(collector)"> 1

	<li><img src="images/5/n5.png" alt="(collector)"> 5
	<li><img src="images/5/n6.png" alt="(collector)"> 6
	<li><img src="images/5/n7.png" alt="(collector)"> 7
	<li><img src="images/5/nS.png" alt="(collector)">
	  <a href="notes.html#scholastic">Scholastic</a> (collect all 
	  immediately-preceding 0-collecting words)
      </ul>
      <p>
      The collector's position can also indicate the &quot;pronomial&quot;
      status of the word.  When this tentacle is in the &quot;SE&quot;
      position, it does not indicate pronomialness.  When this tentacle is 
      in the &quot;ESE&quot; position (slightly above the usual position), 
      it indicates that this word indicates the same thing/concept as the 
      previous word mentioned by this speaker using this word's glyph.
      Occasionally that will not be sufficiently specific; one might wish
      to refer to an occurence other than the previous one.  In that case,
      this tentacle can be placed in the &quot;E&quot; 
      position (directly to the right of the word), which indicates a
      modifier to a multipart pronomial.
      See the <a href="#sentences">sentence structure section</a> for
      more details about collectors.
    <h3><a name="ascii">Ascii form</a></h3>
      The original human xenolinguists studying rikchik language found it 
      necessary to be able to write rikchik words and sentences in
      plain text.  They came up with a simple system.  Each word is
      represented as a 4-part structure:
      <blockquote>
	Rikchik-Patient-R-3
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>The first part is the single-word meaning (or approximation 
	  thereto) of the glyph.  
	<li>The second part is the single-word name of the relation.
	<li>The third part is the single-letter abbreviation for the form.
	  They are:<br>
	    R(Rikchik) for Animate Noun<br>
	    T(Thing) for Inanimate Noun<br>
	    V for Verb<br>
	    M for Modifier<br>
	    N for Name<br>
	    P for Place<br>
	    I for Idea
	<li>The fourth part is the code for the Collector, either a number
	  from 0 to 7 or S.  P or O, for the pronomial and 
	  option-pronomial, may be appended to the Collector as appropriate.
      </ul>

  <h2><a name="sentences">Sentences</a></h2>
    Rikchik sentences are written from top to bottom, left to right.
    However, they have a grammatical structure that humans describe as a
    &quot;tree&quot;.  A tree is a structure of points and lines where
    each point except the bottom one is connected to one and only one
    point below it.  In rikchik sentence trees, the role of points
    is filled by words.  The collector tentacle determines the number
    of lines entering a word, and the relation tentacle determines the
    meaning of a line.  Basically, each word modifies the word that
    collects it in some way.
    <h3><a name="terms">Terms</a></h3>
      In rikchik grammar, a single symbol, consisting of 7 tentacles, is
      a &quot;word&quot;.  A word that is at the top of a tree (no connections
      from words above it) can be referred to as a &quot;leaf&quot;.  Words
      that are not leaves have some number of words connected above them.
      We say that such a word &quot;collects&quot; the words above it.
      The meaning of the connection between words is expressed by the
      Relation tentacle, so those connections are referred to as 
      &quot;relations&quot;.  We also say that the upper word 
      &quot;relates&quot; to the lower word in a certain way.
      Words that have the relation End do not get collected.  If a word
      has some other relation and has not been collected yet, we call
      that word &quot;unresolved&quot;.
    <h3><a name="structure">Tree Structure</a></h3>
      Each word has a Collector tentacle that describes how that word
      affects the tree structure.  The tentacle is associated with a
      number that says how many currently unresolved words that word
      collects.<p>
      As an example, take the sentence on the right.  It means, 
      &quot;A happy rikchik moves along the east-flowing water&quot;.
      (Note: the colored Form, Collector, and Relation tentacles are
      not necessary and are included here as an aide to the learner.)
      <img src="/~dmm/cgi-bin/riksmallcolor.cgi?Happy-Quality-M-0_Rikchik-Patient-R-1_Sun-Source-P-0_Water-Instrument-P-1_Move-End-V-2" 
	  alt="Example Sentence" align=right>
      <ul>
	<br clear=left>
	<li>
	<img src="images/h.png" align = left>
	The first glyph, Happy-Quality-M-0, creates a new leaf.  
	<br clear=left> 
	<li>
	<img src="images/hr.png" align = left>
	The second, Rikchik-Patient-R-1, collects one unresolved word.
	The previous unresolved word is Happy, so Rikchik collects that.  The
	sentence tree now consists of Rikchik collecting Happy.
	<br clear=left> 
	<li>
	<img src="images/hrs.png" align = left>
	The third, Sun-Source-P-0, is another leaf.  There are now two
	unconnected structures in the sentence. (Note: Sun, when coded as
	a P (place), means &quot;East&quot;.)
	<br clear=left> 
	<li>
	<img src="images/hrsw.png" align = left>
	The fourth, Water-Instrument-P-1, collects one unresolved
	word.  There are two unresolved words available, Rikchik and Sun.
	Sun is the most recent, so it is collected.  The sentence still
	consists of two separate structures: Rikchik collecting Happy, and
	Water collecting Sun.
	<br clear=left> 
	<li>
	<img src="images/hrswm.png" align = left>
	The fifth, Move-End-V-2, collects two unresolved words.  It 
	collects both words, and the sentence is a single structure.  This
	word has the End relation, so no unresolved words remain.
	<br clear=left>
      </ul>
      The rikchik language has one departure from strict tree structure.
      That departure is the pronomial, a modification of the Collector
      tentacle.  By putting the Collector in a slightly higher position,
      the speaker or writer indicates that the word so tagged is referring
      to the same thing the previous word using that glyph referred to.
      So, if you want to say something else about the same rikchik that we
      just described going along the river, you could simply use the same
      glyph with a pronomial, as in Rikchik-Agent-R-0P &quot;the previous
      rikchik&quot;:
      <br><img src="/~dmm/cgi-bin/riksmallcolor.cgi?Rikchik-Agent-R-0P"
	  align=center><br>
      The slightly raised position, called the &quot;pronomial&quot;,
      refers to the previous use of that glyph by the
      same speaker.  If you wished to refer to the previous use of a 
      multi-glyph structure, you would specify the modifiers to the
      root glyph with the &quot;option-pronomial&quot;, which is an 
      even more raised position.
      Here is Happy-Quality-M-0O Rikchik-Agent-R-1P &quot;the previous
      happy rikchik&quot;:
      <br><img src="/~dmm/cgi-bin/riksmallcolor.cgi?Happy-Quality-M-0O.Rikchik-Agent-R-1P"
	  align=center><br>
      A final note about pronomials: the pronomial refers to the previous
      word of that glyph.  The non-glyph tentacles do <strong>not</strong>
      have to agree: one could pronomially refer to the water that was a
      place in the previous sentence as an inanimate noun.
    <h3><a name="meaning">Tree Meaning</a></h3>
      The meaning of the parts of a tree is determined by the Relation
      tentacle.  A Relation indicates how the word it is part of modifies
      or describes the word that will collect it.  The most obvious use
      of Relations is to specify the roles of words collected by a verb:
      the subject is tagged as an Agent, the direct object as (usually)
      a Patient, and so on.  Relations are used for all connections,
      however.  At some points more examples will be here.
      <p>
      Notice that what Relations do in the rikchik language is what 
      word order does in many human languages.  Word order is not 
      generally vital to the meaning of a Rikchik sentence.  The 
      exception is when dealing with time, which is 
      <a href="time.html">discussed elsewhere</a>.
