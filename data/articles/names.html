	<h1>Rikchik Names</h1>
	A rikchik's name can have up to 5 different components.  Each one
	is a phrase collected by the <em>Rikchik</em> glyph and relating 
	to it a different way.  All words inside a naming phrase have
	their forms set to <em>N</em> (name).
	<dl>
	    <dt><em>Quality</em>: personal name.
		<img align=right src="images/5/rQuality.png">
	    <dd>A short (1-3 glyph) name belonging to that rikchik.
		Usually given by its parent.  Common Quality-names include
		plants and animals (<em>Sky-Instrument-N-0 
		Fish-Quality-N-1</em>), descriptions (<em>Happy-Quality-N-0 
		Happy-Quality-N-1</em>), and almost any single word 
		(<em>Spot-Quality-N-0</em>).
	    <br clear=right>
	    <dt><em>Source</em>: parent's name. 
		<img align=right src="images/5/rSource.png">
	    <dd>The Quality-name of the rikchik's parent.
	    <br clear=right>
	    <dt><em>Includes</em>: home name. 
		<img align=right src="images/5/rIncludes.png">
	    <dd>The name of the rikchik's home, chosen by the founders
		of the house.  A &quot;single&quot; rikchik will have
		no home name.  Homes tend to have more complicated
		or strange names, since each home in a city needs
		to have a unique name to avoid confusion.
	    <br clear=right>
	    <dt><em>Agent</em>: raising-home name. 
		<img align=right src="images/5/rAgent.png">
	    <dd>The name of the home that the rikchik was raised by.
		Usually the same as the Includes-name of its parent.
	    <br clear=right>
	    <dt><em>Destination</em>: home-city name. 
		<img align=right src="images/5/rDestination.png">
	    <dd>The name of the city the rikchik is from.  Its home
		nation (and planet) can be used instead or added if necessary.
		This name changes when a rikchik moves to another city.
		Rikchiks with no spatial home (travelers, ship crews, etc.)
		usually use &quot;<em>All-Destination-N-0</em>&quot; as their
		Destination-name.

	<em>
	    Happy-Quality-N-0<br>
	    Insect-Agent-N-1<br>
	    Pulser-Source-N-0<br>
	    Sun-Quality-N-0<br>
	    Grass-Destination-N-1<br>
	    Box-Includes-N-0<br>
	    Water-Includes-N-1<br>
	    Sky-Patient-N-0<br>
	    Eye-Quality-N-1<br>
	    Rikchik-End-R-5<br>
	</em>
	Sky Watcher, house of Boxed Water, from Bright Grass city,
	child of Pulser, raised by Happy Insect house.
	(You may find it helpful to see this phrase
	<a href="../cgi-bin/rikparsesmallcolor.cgi?Happy-Quality-N-0.Insect-Agent-N-1.Pulser-Source-N-0.Sun-Quality-N-0.Grass-Destination-N-1.Box-Includes-N-0.Water-Includes-N-1.Sky-Patient-N-0.Eye-Quality-N-1.Rikchik-End-R-5">
	parsed</a>.)
	<p>
	This rikchik would most likely only use this full name for
	official documents.  In daily life it would probably be called
	<em>Sky-Patient-N-0 Eye-Quality-N-1 Rikchik-End-R-1</em>
	(Sky-Watcher), or <em>Box-Includes-N-0 Water-Includes-N-1
	Sky-Patient-N-0 Eye-Quality-N-1 Rikchik-End-R-2</em> 
	(Sky-Watcher Boxed-Water).
	<p>
	If Sky-Watcher was to leave the country, it would perhaps introduce
	itself as <em>Two-Quality-N-0 Sun-Destination-N-1 Sun-Quality-N-0 
	Grass-Destination-N-1 Sky-Patient-N-0 Eye-Quality-N-1 
	Rikchik-End-R-1</em> (Sky-Watcher, from Two-Suns, from Bright-Grass)
	or simply as <em>Two-Quality-N-0 Sun-Destination-N-1 
	Sky-Patient-N-0 Eye-Quality-N-1 Rikchik-End-R-1</em> (Sky-Watcher,
	from Two-Suns) if it doesn't expect to be confused with someone else
	from a different city in Two-Suns.  The watcher (the rikchik being
	talked to) is expected to be able to distinguish between city
	names and country names, though there is no clear way to do so
	other than knowing all the country names.  A city name is usually
	not also the name of a country.
