<h1>Rikchik mating practices</h1>
(Note: this page is based on a post to the CONLANG list.)
<p>
All this talk of alien sexual practices, I had to chime in with some info
on rikchik mating.
<p>
Rikchiks are not gendered... there is only one rikchik gender.

Adult rikchiks join into family groups with their close friends.  Few
families grow larger than seven rikchiks (seven being an auspicious
number for rikchiks the same way 5 or 10 are for humans).  A family
group is &quot;Home-?-R-0&quot; (an animate home). [left]

Rikchiks do not wear clothes, but they do paint themselves.  General
painting styles vary, but one thing that has endured for a long time
is that each family devises a symbol representing their family, and
that symbol is painted on the back side of the globe head/body by one
of the other family members.  Single rikchiks do not paint anything on
the back of their globe.  &quot;Paint&quot; in the sense of painting on
the globe is a separate glyph.  The family 
symbol is &quot;Home-Agent-N-0 Paint-?-T-1&quot; (paint called &quot;done 
by the family&quot;). [right]

Reproduction involves 2 or more rikchiks, the &quot;parent&quot; and one or 
more &quot;contributors.&quot;  The parent carries and gives birth to the 
child and provides half of the genetic material of the child.  The contributors
provide the other half, between them.  The sexual act tends to take at least a
full day.  A parent usually asks one or more
of its family members to contribute to its child.  The child born lives
with the family, but is not considered to be part of the family in the
same way the adults are, and does not have the back of its globe painted.
When it becomes an adult, it is expected to join some other family.
(The glyphs for &quot;Parent&quot;, &quot;Contributor&quot;, and 
&quot;Child&quot; can probably be seen to the left.  The &quot;Source&quot; 
relation is often used to identify one's parent. The verb form of 
&quot;Parent&quot; and &quot;Contributor&quot; refer to the sexual act; the 
verb form of &quot;Child&quot; refers to birth.)

Selection has varying nuances, but rikchiks have considered a very
spherical globe to be &quot;beautiful&quot; since the first rikchik dragged
itself out of the ocean.  Sexual selection has created the very spherical
rikchiks that exist in these times.  (Beautiful is often expressed as
&quot;Happy-Result-N-0 Globe-?-M-1&quot;.) [right]

It is uncommon for a modern rikchik to be the parent of two children, and 
extremely rare to have more than two.  Most have one, with a few never being 
a parent at all.  A rikchik will often contribute to many children, depending 
on its family.  In the past, birth rates were higher, but it has always been
very rare for a single rikchik to have 4 or more children.  This is part 
of the reason the

collector</a> is called what it is.

Non-procreative sex is unheard of (the rikchiks say &quot;Physically impossible&quot;)
but a related (and shorter) pleasurable multirikchik act is often performed by
family members and occasionally outside of a family, especially by young
adults.  This act has its own glyph and is usually translated into English
as &quot;Stroke.&quot; [left]

As there is only one gender, there is no issue of hetero or homosexuality,
but a parallel issue of &quot;Xenosexuality&quot; has come up since contact.  Rikchiks
who invite humans or other aliens into their families and/or engage in
stroking are beginning to appear, though this is looked down upon by
many rikchiks, especially veterans of the rikchik-human war.  The phrase
usually used for this is some combination of &quot;Human-Agent-N-0&quot; or
&quot;Human-Patient-N-0&quot; and &quot;[Home|Stroke]-?-V-1&quot;. [right]
