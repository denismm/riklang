  <dt><a name="capitalization">Capitalizing &quot;rikchik&quot;</a>
    <dd>The word &quot;rikchik&quot; is not capitalized in this work.
      This is because &quot;human&quot; is not capitalized.  Since the
      rikchiks treat their word for human no differently than their
      word for rikchik, I figured it would be only polite to return the
      favor.
  <dt><a name="seven">Seven</a>
    <dd>Rikchiks are very seven based: they have sevens like humans have
      fives.  The rikchik language has a word for seven, but to actually
      talk about seven things, the words 1 and 0 are usually used instead
      (as they have a base-seven number system).  In normal speech, 
      &quot;seven&quot; tends to mean &quot;many&quot;.  &quot;Seven
      sevens&quot; is &quot;very many&quot;.
  <dt><a name="scholastic">The &quot;Scholastic&quot; collector</a>
    <dd>The scholastic collector, which collects all 0-collecting
      words immediately preceding it, gets its name from rikchik family
      forms.  It is very rare for a rikchik to give birth to more than 
      two children (though a rikchik may <em>contribute</em> to more: rikchiks
      are <a href="mating.html">not gendered</a>), so a rikchik that has 
      many children around it is probably a teacher, not a parent.  
      From this, the collector allowing collection of large numbers of 
      non-collecting words took on the name &quot;scholastic&quot; since it 
      is a full-grown word taking care of many little words.
