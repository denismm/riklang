    <h1>Rikchiks</h1>
      The <a href="notes.html#capitalization">rikchiks</a> are a race of
      intelligent creatures from the 2nd planet of Alpha Centauri A.
      <h2><a href="physiology.html">Rikchik Physiology</a></h2>
      <a href="/~dmm/rpg/reaching.jpg"><img src="/~dmm/rpg/reachingclip.png" align=left></a>
	There is more information about rikchik physiology on <a href="physiology.html">another page</a>.  Some highlights:<br/>
	The rikchik body consists of a large (~2 ft. diameter) sphere,
	  which contains almost all the rikchik's organs, supported by 49
	  long (~6 ft.) tentacles.
	In the front of the sphere is a single eye with a circular eyelid.  
	The 7 tentacles immediately below the eye are shorter and lighter, 
	    and are used for talking and fine manipulation.
	Non-talking tentacles are used both for locomotion and
	  for manipulation.
	Rikchiks have no sense of hearing.
	Their skin requires moisture to stay healthy.
	Skin color and eye color are both a medium green.
	A mouth-equivalent is at the bottom of the sphere, at the center
	  of the tentacles.
      <br clear=all>
      <h2><a href="language/language.html">Rikchik Language</a></h2>
	The rikchiks' language is covered on 
	<a href="language/language.html">another page</a>.
	Briefly, they use their tentacles to communicate in a sign language.
	Their grammatical structure is very versatile, and their vocabulary
	is logographic.
      <h2>Rikchik homeworld</h2>
	A small, warm planet, with one main continent. See the
        <a href="reference/rikworld.html">planet and system information
	page</a>.
      <h2>Rikchik culture</h2>
	More here as I write it.  So far information is available on
	  <a href="mating.html">mating practices</a> and
	  <a href="religion.html">religion</a>.
      <h2>Rikchik technology</h2>
	More here as I write it.  For now, suffice it to say that when they
	came in contact with humanity, human and rikchik tech levels were
	more or less equivalent.
      <h2>Rikchik history</h2>
	More here as I write it.

      <h2>Latest news</h2>
	    29Jan2003: New language reference is up, though incomplete.  The 
	    main rikchik.html page has been edited to bring its terminology
	    up to date (&quot;glyph&quot; becomes &quot;morpheme&quot; and
	    &quot;form&quot; becomes &quot;aspect&quot;.).
      <h2>Older news</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li>24May2001: Added religion page and reference pages recently.
	    <li>On 31Dec2000 I changed the way the M and N forms and the 3 
	    and 6 collectors were drawn.  3 is hardly noticeable, but the 
	    others are dramatic changes.  This should make the language 
	    easier to write, read, and sign.  All the images should have 
	    automatically updated, but let me know if I missed any.
	    <li>I've just (05Nov2000) switched to a system that generates 
	    my png files from PostScript, instead of me having to make 
	    them by hand.  Some images may look a little wierd (circles 
	    not closing or not symmetrical, mostly) until I get all the bugs 
	    worked out.  Thanks for your patience!  I'm doing this so that 
	    the typewriter can get new glyphs faster (Emotion, Shoe, and 
	    Circle are all new).
	</ul>

      <h2>Browser note</h2>
	Rikchik is an logographic language, so you won't get much out
	of this site with a non-graphical browser.  Graphics-wise, I've
	used the <code>align</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
	tag often, and made some use of tables.   I've switched to PNGs for the
	assembled words.  I think everything should
	look all right on most every browser, but if something breaks your 
	browser, please <a href="mailto:dmm@suberic.net">let me know at 
	dmm@suberic.net</a>.  Thanks!
