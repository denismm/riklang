<p>
The "aspect" in a rikchik <a href="word.html">word</a> is the <a href="tentacle.html">tentacle</a> in the lower left.  It specifies which of up to seven meanings the <a href="morpheme.html">morpheme</a> represents.
<p>
The seven aspects in standard rikchik, and their example meanings for &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Fight&quot;, are as follows:
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/coloraT.png">Inanimate (&quot;T&quot;, for &quot;thing&quot;): a nonmoving, physical thing.  This includes plants and dead creatures, but not flowing water or celestial bodies; see next aspect.
<br><strong>Home-T:</strong> a home or house
<br><strong>Fight-T:</strong> a weapon
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/coloraR.png">Animate (&quot;R&quot;, for &quot;rikchik&quot;): a physical thing that moves under its own power.  This includes unexpected &quot;creatures&quot; like rivers and the sun, as well as functioning self-driven vehicles.  (The earlier repulsion-carts, which were pushed or punted like gondolas, are inanimate, but modern repulsion-drive carriages are animate unless they are broken.) Can also mean a collection of living things, or a living organ.
<br><strong>Home-R:</strong> a family
<br><strong>Fight-R:</strong> a living weapon (used poetically or metaphorically)
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/coloraP.png">Place (&quot;P&quot;): a location, either physically or figuratively.  A time, like &quot;morning&quot;, can be a place.  Whether a physical object is inanimate or a place is often a matter of emphasis: Home-T is a building that you could put your tentacle on, Home-P is a place to be with your family and relatives.
<br><strong>Home-P:</strong> a house (as a place)
<br><strong>Fight-P:</strong> a battleground
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/coloraI.png">Idea (&quot;I&quot;): an abstract concept.  In practice, often a catch-all for any meaning that doesn't fit elsewhere.  Ideas include stories, events, and units of measurement.
<br><strong>Home-I:</strong> (no clear meaning)
<br><strong>Fight-I:</strong> a battle
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/coloraV.png">Verb (&quot;V&quot;): an action or other verb-like concept.  Rikchik has no copula (&quot;is&quot;); relations are used instead (&quot;a happy rikchik&quot; instead of &quot;the rikchik is happy&quot;, &quot;I-including a human&quot; instead of &quot;I am a human&quot;).  This means that verbs are not required in a sentence, and that many English verbs are not verbs in rikchik.  Also, there is no need to alter verbs to get them to fit elsewhere in the sentence, as &quot;eat&quot; can be used as a subject, so there is no equivalent to gerunds like &quot;eating&quot;.
<br><strong>Home-V:</strong> marry, make a family
<br><strong>Fight-V:</strong> fight
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/coloraM.png">Modifier (&quot;M&quot;): a description or other modifying word.  As above, aspects specify meaning, not true &quot;part of speech&quot;, so there's no difference between &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;happiness&quot;, and &quot;to be happy&quot;.
<br><strong>Home-M:</strong> comfortable
<br><strong>Fight-M:</strong> violent
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/coloraN.png">Name (&quot;N&quot;): this aspect indicates that the meaning of the attached morpheme is not directly important.  It's used in <a href="compound.html">compound words</a> and in <a href="name.html">names</a>.
<br><strong>Home-N-Quality-0 Rikchik-R-End-1:</strong> a rikchik named &quot;home&quot;.
<br><strong>Fight-N-Task-0 Home-P-End-1:</strong> a military base.
<p>
Each word's paradigm provides a default reading for one or more aspects.
