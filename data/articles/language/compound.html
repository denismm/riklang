The <img src="../images/classic/3/coloraN.png">Name (&quot;N&quot;) 
<a href="aspect.html">aspect</a> is used for both 
<a href="name.html">names</a> and compound words.  For compound words, every
word collected by the base word takes the N aspect, indicating that it's to 
be considered a more direct part of that word than usual.  The other parts
of the word function normally.
<p>
Usually, any further collections of the compound word are collected by the
base word, but in certain cases the collected words collect other words.
The most common such case is in <a href="time.html">telling time</a>.
