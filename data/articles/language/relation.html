<p>
The "relation" in a rikchik <a href="word.html">word</a> is the 
<a href="tentacle.html">tentacle</a> on the top.  It indicates the semantic
nature of the connection between the word's 
<a href="morpheme.html">morpheme</a> and the morpheme that collects it.
The relation of a word is analogous to the case or sentence position of a
word in many human languages.
<p>
Every relation has a range of related meanings.  A collecting word may specify
meanings for the relations of the words it collects: these are called its 
"roles".
<p>
The eight basic relations in standard rikchik are:
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/colorrSource.png"><strong>Source:</strong>
The producer of an object, the origin of a movement, or the cause of
an action.
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/colorrAgent.png"><strong>Agent:</strong>
The actor in an action.  Similar to the subject of an English transitive
verb, but not in all cases.  (Compare Patient.)
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/colorrQuality.png"><strong>Quality:</strong>
The quality of a word.  Analogous to both adjectives and adverbs.
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/colorrInstrument.png"><strong>Instrument:</strong>
Any object, person, or action used for the purpose of the collecting word.
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/colorrPatient.png"><strong>Patient:</strong>
The acted-upon party in an action.  Similar to the object of English transitive
verbs, and to the subject of intransitive verbs.  (Compare Agent.)
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/colorrDestination.png"><strong>Destination:</strong>
The destination of a movement or  the purpose of an action.
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/colorrIncludes.png"><strong>Includes:</strong>
The container of an object or the location of an action.
<p>
<img src="../images/classic/3/colorrEnd.png"><strong>End:</strong>
The end of a sentence.  (Often the verb in simple sentences.)  Indicates that
the word is not collected.
<p>
All of these relations except End have reciprocals, which are
relations that indicate the same connection but with the roles of the
collecting and collected words reversed.  Reciprocals are formed by horizontal
reversal of the original relation, except for the Includes relation, which is
vertically reversed instead, and the Instrument relation, which is a short 
vertical line instead of a long horizontal one.
