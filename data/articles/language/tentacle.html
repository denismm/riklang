<h1>Tentacles</h1>
The rikchik language is signed by the rikchiks using their seven
"speaking tentacles", which are located directly below the eye.
Even in the written form, the lines representing tentacle positions
are referred to as "tentacles".  Each written tentacle represents, the
position, shape, and orientation of a speaking tentacle as it is used
in the expression of a <a href="word.html">word</a>.
The seven tentacles in a word are the four central 
<a href="morpheme.html">morpheme</a> tentacles,
the lower left <a href="aspect.html">aspect</a> tentacle, 
the upper <a href="relation.html">relation</a> tentacle, 
and the lower right <a href="collector.html">collector</a> tentacle. 
<p>
Throughout this language reference, the aspect, relation, and collector 
tentacles are colored red, blue, and green respectively.  These colors 
are provided as an aid to learning and are not part of the usual 
presentation of the language.
<!-- The tentacle shapes are also used to sort morphemes. -->
