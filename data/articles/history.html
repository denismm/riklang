I started drawing rikchiks (sometimes called rikchikkers) in junior
high or maybe high school - that would be mid-to-late 1980s.  They
were green spheres with a single eye and some undefined number of long
tentacles. For a while I thought they'd have a spoken language, with
words like "Ch'kratl", but never really developed it.

Meanwhile, I learned French and Esperanto, with a little Russian and
some Japanese. When I got to college, I took 4 successful and 1
unsuccessful semester of Japanese, and also read through some Lojban
info at some point (though I don't remember much of that.)  I've also
always been interested in logo design, artistic communication, and
such.

My senior year (1995), I wrote some short stories for a creative
writing class that had rikchiks in them.  Those rikchiks spoke a very
complicated language that was obliquely described but never really
developed - it had the phrase "Kh'tro kh'tro", the "osmotic declension
of the scholastic pronomial", and an attractive script that was
suitable for graffiti-ing of pillars.  During that period I decided
that rikchiks would have a "law of sevens" instead of the human "law
of fives" and settled on 49 as the number of tentacles they would
have.

After writing those stories, I realized that rikchiks had no obvious
ears or mouths, and started thinking about what their language would
be like if they were deaf.  Before graduating, I came up with the idea
of tentacle sign language, and even the idea of a 4-tentacle central
piece and 3 diacritic tentacles, though the outer tentacles had no
meaning at that time. I know I came up with the glyph for "Happy" at
this time, and may have come up with some other earlier ones like Home
and Sun.

After graduating rikchik stagnated for a year but I got back into it
at the end of 1996 and the start of 1997, getting the language into
enough of a good shape that I felt good about releasing in to the
world.  I posted a version of the "rikchik.html" page that's still on
my site (but maybe not for much longer) and sent an announcement mail
to the CONLANG mailing list.  It's been growing in bits since then.
Sometime in the late 1990s I switched over to using Postscript for all
of the glyph images and such - see
http://suberic.net/~dmm/rikchik/technical.html for details on the
behind-the-scenes maintenance.  Those changes really made it much
easier to add to the language.

I started the rikchik lj in August 2002, which has helped push me to
keep writing in rikchik and to add to the language when I can't say
something.

Is any of that "inspiration"?  I'm not sure.  Maybe I should just say
that I was influenced by Japanese, Esperanto, stack-based programming
languages, graphic design, and whatever else was around.
