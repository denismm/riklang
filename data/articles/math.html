Numbers:
<ul>
    <li>N aspect above base number</li>
    <li>Source: power of 7
	23 = 3 * 7 + 2 = Three-Source-N-0 Two-End-I-1
    </li>
    <li>Destination: power of 1/7
	Pi =~ 3 1/7 = One-Destination-N-0 Three-End-I-1
	  (to more accuracy: Three-Destination-N-0 Six-Destination-N-1  
	  Six-Destination-N-1 Zero-Destination-N-1 Three-End-I-1)
    <li>Repeating septimals use pronomial:
    </li>
	1/2 = 3/7 + 3/49 + 3/343... = Three-Destination-N-0 
	  Three-Destination-N-1P Zero-End-I-1
	9.25 = One-Source-N-0 One-Destination-N-0 Five-Destination-N-1
	One-Destination-N-1P Two-End-I-2
    </li>
</ul>
Using numbers:
<ul>
    <li>Cardinal: 1 of something, one time: One-Quality-M-0 
	  (All-Quality-M-0 = All)</li>
    <li>Ordinal: 1st something: One-Agent-M-0 (All-Agent-M-0 = Last)
    </li>
    <li>Comparative: More than 1 other: One-Patient-M-0 (All-Patient-M-0 = Most)
	  (Note that this is the reverse of English #1, etc.  
	  Zero-Patient-M-0 = Least)
