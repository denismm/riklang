<h1>Rikchik religious practices</h1>
The mainstream culture of rikchiks (the Two-Suns Alliance and its neighbors)
shares a majority religion based on the Seven Gods.  The worship of these
deities has been more and less widespread throughout history, but it has
had a majority since before the Golden Age.  The temples and priests of
these Gods are an integral part of life in this culture.

Young priests will be priests of one particular god, but as they mature they will take on other gods, eventually becoming priests of one god, its neighbors, and Home.
