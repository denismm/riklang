    <h2>
      Tenses, timing
    </h2>
    The rikchik way of speaking about time is centered on one glyph,
    usually called &quot;Sequence&quot;.  The purpose of Sequence
    is to collect successive moments using the Agent relation.
    Each collected word defines a moment, more or less.

    <img src="/~dmm/cgi-bin/riksmall.cgi?Human-Patient-R-0.Home-Destination-P-0.Move-Patient-V-2.Rikchik-Patient-R-0.Home-Source-P-0P.Move-Patient-V-2.Gather-Agent-V-2.Sequence-End-I-1" align = right>
    For instance, to say that a human
    went into a house and then a rikchik came out of the house, the
    sentence would be:<p>
    Human-Patient-R-0<br>
    Home-Destination-P-0<br>
    Move-Agent-V-2<br>
    Rikchik-Patient-R-0<br>
    Home-Source-P-0P<br>
    Move-Agent-V-2<br>
    Sequence-End-I-2<p>
    (as shown on the left.)
    <p>
    If the human went into the house at the <em>same time</em> the 
    rikchik left, it would be:<p>
    Human-Patient-R-0<br>
    Home-Destination-P-0<br>
    Move-Patient-V-2<br>
    Rikchik-Patient-R-0<br>
    Home-Source-P-0P<br>
    Move-Patient-V-2<br>
    Gather-Agent-V-2<br>
    Sequence-End-I-1<p>
    (as shown on the right)
    so that the two movements would be collected as the same moment.
    <p>
    Tenses are usually indicated with the &quot;Me/Here/Now&quot; glyph.
    More examples later.
    <p>
    Sentences that end without a sequence are usually assumed to be in
    the recent past.  The remote past is usually specified with an
    opening sentence of the &quot;Once upon a time&quot; variety.
    Rikchiks have a stock selection of such phrases, for different 
    times and places in their history.  These opening sentences may be
    collected with a Source relation to emphasize their opening-ness;
    likewise, a closing sentence may be collected with a Destination
    relation.  Neither of these should be sentences that actually
    specify events that are &quot;part of the story&quot;; they are
    establishing or framing devices only.
    <p>
    The length of time between two events in a Sequence may be specified
    by having the Sequence, between collecting those two events,
    collect a length of time with the Quality relation.
    <p>
    The imperative is usually accomplished by putting something in the
    near future and stating it as fact.  The English equivalent would
    be something like &quot;Now. Next, you coming here.&quot;  A more 
    polite imperative results from putting a nothing option with the 
    statement: &quot;Now. Next, you coming here, or not.&quot;  
    Better examples later.
    <br clear=all>
    <h2>Time spans</h2>
    <img src="images/5/gSpan.png" align=right>
    When lengths of time are referred to directly, the Span glyph
    is used.  A quick breakdown of common terms follows.  For each
    unit of time, the glyphs that Span collects are listed.  (A
    Span tends to take the I (Idea) form.)
    <ul>
      <li>Day: <a href="/~dmm/cgi-bin/rikchik.cgi?Sun-Agent-T-0.Span-Quality-I-1">Sun-Agent-T-0</a>
      <li>Week: <a href="/~dmm/cgi-bin/rikchik.cgi?Seven-Quality-N-0.Span-Quality-I-1">Seven-Quality-N-0</a> (Rikchiks, being seven-based,
	group days into seven-day-weeks.)
      <li>Year: <a href="/~dmm/cgi-bin/rikchik.cgi?Tree-Patient-T-0.Span-Quality-I-1">Tree-Patient-T-0</a>
    </ul>
    The rikchik homeworld has no moons, so there is no &quot;month&quot;
    equivalent.
