      Fish is a general term for a family of similar-looking sea and water creatures. They all have a flattish, conical head/body, which bears a forward-facing eye and a downward-facing mouth, which is surrounded by extremely strong dangling tentacles. Fish have control over their buoyancy, like a submarine. Fish eat sea plants, minerals, and small water animals. They are representatives of the most primitive animals on the rikchik homeworld to be able to eat minerals.
